# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JI1IN

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m a junior developer with a strong passion for **Web Development** and a keen interest in beautiful and responsive websites. I love exploring new technologies and continuously expanding my skill set.

## ðŸš€ Currently Learning

Iâ€™m currently focusing on expanding my expertise in:

- **Python**: Using frameworks like "Flask" to build the backend of my web-applications
- **SQL**: SQL for anything that requires databases (pretty useful for any applications involving user data)
- **ReactJs**: Using React to build better websites
- **TailwindCSS**: Currently experimenting with different frameworks like TailwindCSS or BootStrap5 to expand my knowledge.

## ðŸŒŸ Fun Facts

- **Elden Ring Enthusiast**: Iâ€™m a dedicated fan of Elden Ring and enjoy soulslike games. I love getting beaten over and over again by a boss.
- **Animanga Aficionado**: Iâ€™m a huge fan of anime and manga, with **'Erased'** being my all-time favorite anime and **'Goodnight PunPun'** my top manga pick.
- **Codewars**: I love doing some coding problems when I am bored. Codewars is a platform where users all around the world try to solve coding problems labeled as "Katas".
