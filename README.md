# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m a junior developer with a passion for **Web Development** and a keen interest in clean and responsive websites. I love exploring new technologies and continuously expanding my skill set.


Iâ€™m currently focusing on expanding my expertise in:

- **Python**: Using frameworks like "Flask" to build the backend of my web-applications. Currently learning the data structures in this one.
- **SQL**: SQL for anything that requires databases.
- **ReactJs**: Using React to build better websites.
- **NextJs**: Currently learning how to use this React framework
- **TailwindCSS**: Currently experimenting with different frameworks and libraries like TailwindCSS to expand my knowledge.


- **Elden Ring**: Iâ€™m a dedicated fan of Elden Ring and enjoy soulslike games. I love getting beaten over and over again by a boss.
- **Animanga**: Iâ€™m a huge fan of anime and manga, with **'Erased'** being my all-time favorite anime and **'Goodnight PunPun'** my favourite manga.
- **Codewars**: I love doing some coding problems when I am bored. Codewars is a platform where users all around the world try to solve coding problems labeled as "Katas".
